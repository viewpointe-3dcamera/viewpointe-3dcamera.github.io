# Parts List
### PolarFire FPGA 4K Dual Camera Video Kit DG0849
The PolarFire FPGA Video Kit comes with two major components as part of it. They are as follows:
PolarFire Video Imaging Board
The PolarFire Video Board comes with the MPF300T-1FCG1152E FPGA mounted on it
It comes with a 64 bit RISC-V CPU, which has a 148.5 MHz maximum clock frequency, and is compatible with MIPI CSI-2, DSI and CS interfaces
The board has HDMI 2.0 and HDMI 1.4 ports available for use.

### Dual Camera Sensor Board
This PCB comes with two cameras mounted on it at a fixed distance, which allows for two separate lines of sight. However, it doesnâ€™t allow for adjustment of the distance between the two lenses.
This board can be connected directly to the PolarFIre Video Imaging board using the pins.
This sensor board is swapped out for the Alcon Camera Lenses.

### 4K Sensor Adaptor Board (Sponsor Tech)
This board was developed by Alcon to resolve compatibility issues with the Alcon camera lenses. Using this adapter board allows for the use of the 4K HDMI Port.

### Alcon Camera Lenses (Sponsor Tech)
These lenses were developed by Alcon to allow adjustment of the distance between the lenses to account for the object, which would give better focus and production of the final 3D image. These camera lenses are two lenses that are independent of each other and can be connected to the 4K Sensor Adaptor board. 

### 4K 3D Television (Provided by Alcon)
This was provided to us by Alcon which supports side-by-side, top-bottom, row interleaved and column interleaved 3D picture formats. The monitor supports HDMI and DisplayPort and we can use these compatibilities to connect it to the PolarFire FPGA Video Imaging Board
